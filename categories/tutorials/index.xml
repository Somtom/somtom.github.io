      <description>Dashboards are nice tools when it comes to analyzing quickly changing data. Nevertheless,you may also use them for reporting purposes by taking snapshots. R has a nice librarycalled flexdashboard which you can use for creating dashboards out of RMarkdown files.During a project at work we found a nice solution for dynamically rendering flexdashboard pagesby using R Markdown child templates which I want to share with you in this blog post.</description>

      <description>The aim of todayâ€™s blog post is to give a short introduction into the usage of BigQuery inside of R. BigQuery is a product within the Google Cloud Platform and serves as a data warehouse for storage and analytics at high scale. It supports standard SQL dialect which makes it easy to use for people with SQL experience.
We are going to use one of the public data sets available on BigQuery and have a short look at the recorded incidents of the San Francisco Police Departments.</description>
