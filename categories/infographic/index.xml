      <description>During this year’s summer break there had been a railway construction site which affected the train I usually use for commuting to work. This led to a lot of additional commuting time. Thus, I decided to repair my old mountain bike and give it a try to go to work by bike.
During the one hour ride I wondered how many people made the same decision and if there would be any data about Munich bike traffic with the use of which I could get some insights about Munich’s bike traffic.</description>
