      <description>About this blog Hello and welcome to my first data analysis blog!
In order to further improve my skills in these fields I decided to start a blog where I could post some of my analysis to get feedback from the community. Since I really appreciate the freely available resources online, I also wanted to give something back. That&amp;rsquo;s why I am planning to post resources which helped me on my continuing path to becoming a data analyst or to provide some small tutorials for things I recently learned.</description>

      <description>Biography After growing up on a small farm near Nürnberg in Germany I studied Agricultural Science and Agricultural Management with a focus on animal behavior. If you had asked me about data analysis and coding at this time, I would not have been able to tell you very much about these topics. My Journey into the world of data science, machine learning and coding began with my Master Thesis where I started to develop a early disease identification model for calves on automatic feeders together with the Förster Technik GmbH.</description>
