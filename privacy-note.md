  obtain Your exact location)

We never use this information to identify single persons but only for anonymous
statistical analysis in order to improve our website.

## What is our legal basis of processing Personal Data?

The legal basis of processing is our legitimate interest (Art. 6 (1) f GDPR)

questions or contact requests by the User.


## Who else does receive the Personal Data we collect?

In order to analyse our website traffic we use Google Analytics, a web analytics service
of the Google Inc. ("Google"), as well as Google's Google Tag Manager. 

For this purpose, data like 

* Online Identifiers, including cookie identifiers and anonymized IP addresses 
* Device identifiers like Your operating system or the browser You're using
* Websites from which You're referred to our page or links You click on our page
* Time of server request

is usually sent to Google's servers in the USA and stored there.  
We added a piece of code to this integration of Google Analytics which anonymizes Your IP address. 
It works by shortening Users' IP addresses within member states of the European Union or in
other contracting states to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional
cases will the complete IP address be sent to a Google server and shortened within the US.

Google is certified under the Privacy Shield Program and thus guaranties GDPR compliance including 
appropriate security measures to protect User data.

reports on activities on our website.
