      <description>The aim of today’s blog post is to give a short introduction into the usage of BigQuery inside of R. BigQuery is a product within the Google Cloud Platform and serves as a data warehouse for storage and analytics at high scale. It supports standard SQL dialect which makes it easy to use for people with SQL experience.
We are going to use one of the public data sets available on BigQuery and have a short look at the recorded incidents of the San Francisco Police Departments.</description>

      <description>Everybody knows the Oktoberfest which takes place in Munich every year. In this blog post series we are going to look into a public availabe dataset and try to gain some insights about the Oktoberfest.
In the first part we loaded and described the data. We also analysed the price and consumption of beer and hendl (chicken) over the years.
In this second part we are going to have a closer look at the Bavarian Central Agricultural Festival - also known as “ZLF”.</description>
