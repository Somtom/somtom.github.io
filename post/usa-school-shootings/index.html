<h1>22…</h1>
<p>… this is the count of school shootings which took place in USA within the first 21 weeks in 2018. Statistically this means that <strong>there has been more than 1 shooting per week.</strong> The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/05/18/2018-has-been-deadlier-for-schoolchildren-than-service-members/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.9ef6aff4ac6d">Washington Post</a> wrote that this led to more deaths at schools than members of the US military have been killed while being deployed this year.</p>
<p>We hear about those shootings quite often in the news, and after almost every of theses a new discussion about the USA gun laws arises. Nevertheless, I do not want to get into theses discussions here but rather share some of my research with you. I was wondering if I could visualize USA school shootings on a map and decided to create a interactive dashboard to explore the data a little bit further. I found the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_school_shootings_in_the_United_States">School Shootings in the United States</a> Wikipedia article which I used as a datasource for my project.</p>
<p><a href="https://somtom.shinyapps.io/usa_school_shootings_shiny/"><img src="../additional_data/images/school-shootings-dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard Screenshot" /></a></p>
<p>We need to keep in mind that, hidden behind all these data and statistics, there are people. People who died, people who got injuried, people who have been crying for their friends and family members and even more. Feel free to explore the data by your own to get a feeling for all those incidents and victims:</p>
<p><a href="https://somtom.shinyapps.io/usa_school_shootings_shiny/">Link to R-Shiny USA School Shootings Dashboard</a></p>
<p><strong>One word of caution at this point:</strong> We cannot be sure that the article has documented every single shooting, but the Wikipedia community is working hard to keep the records up-to-date and adds new entries really quickly. Nevertheless, the present dataset does not raise the claim to be complete and to include every incidents ever happened.</p>
<p>The code for the dashboard can be found on my GitHub account:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Somtom/shiny_dasbhoard_school_shootings_USA">R-Shiny USA School Shootings Dashboard - Code</a></p>
<p>For those who are interested in the data cleaning and preparation, I will go trough this process step by step in the rest of the blog post.</p>

<div id="environment-setup" class="section level1">
<h1>Environment Setup</h1>
<p>In order to read the html tables from the Wikipedia article we are going to use the <code>rvest</code> package. To clean the data we will use the <code>tidyverse</code> package, and to built a interactive map later we are going to use the <code>leaflet</code> package. Further we will need <code>ggmap</code> for geocoding.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>if (!require(rvest)) {
  install.packages(&quot;rvest&quot;)

<div id="load-data-from-wikipedia" class="section level1">
<h1>Load Data from Wikipedia</h1>
<p>To extract the data directly from the Wikipedia article we use the <code>rvest</code> package from Hadley Wickham. This package makes it easy to scrape data from html web pages. You can find some further information on its <a href="https://github.com/hadley/rvest">Github page</a> or on <a href="http://blog.rstudio.com/2014/11/24/rvest-easy-web-scraping-with-r/">this small blogpost</a> from Hadley Wickham.</p>

<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>We need to perform some data processing and cleaning steps so that we can use it for our dashboard. This steps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove duplicated part of <code>Date</code> (i.e. <code>000000001764-07-26-0000July 26, 1764</code>)</li>
<li>Remove duplicated <code>Location</code> after “!”-character (i.e. <code>Greencastle, Pennsylvania !Greencastle, Pennsylvania</code>)</li>
<li>Convert <code>Injuries</code> and <code>Deaths</code> to integer (characters like “?”, “1+”, will be converted to NA)</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>dt &lt;- dt %&gt;% 
  mutate(
    # If Date contains &quot;-0000&quot; then remove the first part from it (first 24 characters)
    Date = ifelse(str_detect(Date, &quot;-0000&quot;), 
                  str_sub(Date, 24),
                  Date),
    # Convert Date to Date type
    Date = parse_date(Date, format = &quot;%B %d, %Y&quot;, locale = locale(&quot;en&quot;)),
    year = as.integer(format(Date, &quot;%Y&quot;)),

                      str_sub(Location, 1, str_locate(Location, &quot; !&quot;)[,1] - 1),
                      Location),

    State = ifelse(words_in_location &gt; 1,
                   str_split_fixed(Location, &quot;,&quot;, n = 2)[,2],

<h2>Geocoding</h2>
<p>Now that we have cleaned the data, we can convert the <code>Location</code> column to latitude and longitude data for our plot by using the <code>geocode()</code> function from the <code>ggmap</code> package. You’ll find a small introduction in my previous <a href="https://somtom.github.io/">blogpost</a>, where I used the package to geocode the addresses from San Francisco Police Departments.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>api_key &lt;- read_lines(&quot;./additional_data/api-key.txt&quot;) #you would need to insert your api key here
register_google(api_key, account_type = &quot;standard&quot;)</code></pre>

# add latitude and longitude data to our data frame
