      <description>The aim of todayâ€™s blog post is to give a short introduction into the usage of BigQuery inside of R. BigQuery is a product within the Google Cloud Platform and serves as a data warehouse for storage and analytics at high scale. It supports standard SQL dialect which makes it easy to use for people with SQL experience.
We are going to use one of the public data sets available on BigQuery and have a short look at the recorded incidents of the San Francisco Police Departments.</description>
