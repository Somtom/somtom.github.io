      <description>22…… this is the count of school shootings which took place in USA within the first 21 weeks in 2018. Statistically this means that there has been more than 1 shooting per week. The Washington Post wrote that this led to more deaths at schools than members of the US military have been killed while being deployed this year.
We hear about those shootings quite often in the news, and after almost every of theses a new discussion about the USA gun laws arises.</description>
