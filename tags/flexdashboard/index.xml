      <description>Dashboards are nice tools when it comes to analyzing quickly changing data. Nevertheless,you may also use them for reporting purposes by taking snapshots. R has a nice librarycalled flexdashboard which you can use for creating dashboards out of RMarkdown files.During a project at work we found a nice solution for dynamically rendering flexdashboard pagesby using R Markdown child templates which I want to share with you in this blog post.</description>
