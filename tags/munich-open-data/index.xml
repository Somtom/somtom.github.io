      <description>Everybody knows the Oktoberfest which takes place in Munich every year. In this blog post series we are going to look into a public availabe dataset and try to gain some insights about the Oktoberfest.
In the first part we loaded and described the data. We also analysed the price and consumption of beer and hendl (chicken) over the years.
In this second part we are going to have a closer look at the Bavarian Central Agricultural Festival - also known as “ZLF”.</description>
